WAParser
========
This project has two purposes:

1. To take an input spread sheet and have its columns matched against a pre-determined map of identifiable content and datatype by allowing the user to drag and drop columns against a default mask via a Tkinter UI interface.

2. To then step through each column and validate its data by purging/replacing characters inconsistent with client requirements.
